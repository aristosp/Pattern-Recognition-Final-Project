# Pattern-Recognition-Final-Project
This repository contains code developed for the final project of the Pattern Recognition course. 
There are three different models for three different datasets(Fashion_MNIST,Cifar10,Cifar100).
The last model is the one I created, the others were given from the project description.
Also, you can find a report of the project in Greek.
